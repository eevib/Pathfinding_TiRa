### Unit testing
At the moment both JPS and Dijkstra have a few Junit tests. The test coverage looks better what it actually is. 

### Manual testing
The route made by both the algorithms can be printed. In the graph the start node is marked with an S and end node marked with an F. From the prited graph you can see which route the graph found. 

### Performance testing
At the moment no performance tests have been made.
