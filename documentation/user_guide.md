### User manual

The java program can be run with giving the command in the directory of the jar file with the command:   

```

java -jar Pathfinding.jar 
```

Note that you need to save the .map and .scen files in the same directory that are used in order for the program to work. 

At the moment the program runs performance tests with 10 randomly chosen routes on map `Denver_2_1024.map` and after that runs Dijkstra and JPS on `Berlin_1_512.map` and draws the routes on the map and prints the map.
