# Week 6

[Hour report](https://github.com/eevib/Pathfinding_TiRa/blob/main/documentation/hours_reporting.md)

## What did I do during week 4?
* Fixed Dijkstra to work with obstacles too.
* Founded and fixed bugs in JPS (jumped with wrong node).
* Got the distance update working. 
* Finally thought I got the JPS working by changing neighbourPruning to adding suitable neighbours instead of taking bad ones off the list. 

## Problems:
* JPS as a whole was very time consuming and dificult. Already thought it was working until I found a path which didn't work. It founds a path, but it is not the shortest. 

## Next week:
* A lot to do and time is running out.'
* Figuring out what still is wrong in JPS.
* More tests for both JPS and Dijkstra, both Junit tests and performance tests.
* Comparing the algorithms with bigger maps.
* Writing all needed documents.
