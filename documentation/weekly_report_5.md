# Week 5

[Hour report](https://github.com/eevib/Pathfinding_TiRa/blob/main/documentation/hours_reporting.md)

## What did I do during week 4?
* Fighted with JPS algorithm. Still not working, getting forward one step and two babckwards. 
* Thought I had it somehow close and found out that the distances doesn't work as it should. 
* At the moment it doesn't work as it should. The printed distance and heuristic table helps to figue out where the problem lies.

## Problems:
* Implement JPS, I think the biggest problem now is where to compare the founded node with the ones already found and update the nodes[][] list with the best route. I think I need to use another table or somekind of list to save the jump points for this. Unfotrunately I run out of energy to make tests this week. 

## Next week:
* Same as last week, getting JPS done. 
* More tests.
* Starting comparing the algorithms.
