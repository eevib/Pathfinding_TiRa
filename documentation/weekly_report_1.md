# Week 1

[Hour report](https://github.com/eevib/Pathfinding_TiRa/blob/main/documentation/hours_reporting.md)

## What did I do during week 1?
* Chose a topic.
* Familiarized me wth the algorithms I will use (Dijkstra and JPS). 
* Tried to figure out how the visualisation could be done.

## Problems:
* The biggest problem is to know what to do and in which order.
* Feeling lost and having lots of problems with just getting started.

## Next week:
* Getting started with the coding.
* Trying to get a clear picture of what to do and where to go next.
